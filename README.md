**Name of Company**


> Nvidia - ("invidia" the latin word for envy, and the acronym NV (short for "next vision") ) is an American multinational semi-conductor corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California.


**When was the company incorporated?**


 Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky & Curtis Priem.      All 3 men recollect the company starting at a particular Dennys Diner in Silicon Valley, Ca..

**Who are the founders of the company?**


Per Jensen Huangs Twitter X profile, He (Huang), Malachowsky & Priem founded NVIDIA in search of solving the problem of 3d graphics for the PC - Personal Computer (Video & Computer Games). Jensen Huang the Co-Founder & CEO, is a foreign-born American Engineer that was working for LSi Logistics at the time. Malakowsky & Priem were elctrical engineers for Sun Microsystems. All 3 men had a background in electrical and computer engineering. Curtis recollects it all starting in 1993 at the Dennys in silicon valley. Typically these young engineers would meet there to brainstorm how to build computer chips.

Jensen (actually named Jen-Hsun)was born in Taiwan (1963) and moved to Thailand at the age of 5. At the age of 9 (early 70's) Huangs father sent him and his brother to the United States. Huangs father wanted to give his children the opportunity for a better life. The Vietnam war was raging on and Huangs father felt the region was unstable. Huangs father had been part of a worker-training program in the US with the air conditioning manufacturer carrier. Jensen Huang and his older brother started in Tacoma, Washington with his uncle and eventually moved to Kentucky. Jensen and his older brother learned english and had a hard time fitting in. The boys went to a boarding school for troubled youth and barely spoke english in Kentucky. Jensen was put to be roomates w one of the schools troublemakers and made a deal with him. Jensen and his roomates deal was Jensen would teach him to read and the roomate would teach him to lift weights. Jensen never stopped working out. According to differnet people that know him he can bench press with the biggest and toughest. The tough times they made it through and eventually their parents emigrated as well. They moved to Portland, Oregon as a family. Jensen Huang got his undergraduate in electrical engineering in 1984 from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1992.

**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?***


When NVIDIA first started, their goal was to focus on a single niche: building powerful computer chips to create graphics for fast moving video games. They noticed 3d graphics in video games were computationally demanding and put alot of strain on the Personal Computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit). They designed a special kind of programmable computer chip to run parallel the CPU. The GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) was a totally different concept than CPU's. GPU's were a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate the computer graphics and image processing. Soon to find that the GPU's could process calculations concurrently in a way that regular CPU's at the time (in the early 90's) could not. GPU's were more energy efficient and better able to handle sophisticaed computing demands. NVIDIA's designs of chips (GPU's) were the start of a computer growth in HyperSpeed."There was no market in 1993" "We were at the beginning." [Curtis Malachowsky - Forbes 2022].

  

*"Our company is 30 days from going out of business"*

In 1996 Nvidia hit their first rocky patch. After a round of layoffs (more than half their employees) Huang took who was left of the company and said "Our company is thirty days from going out of business". This - now the companys un-official motto - was the first thing Jensen could say. The company was in hail mary mode now (football reference) . According to multiple reports Nvidia had a contract with Microsoft for their gaming software for the New Sega Dreamcast and Nvidia didnt deliver a product that worked. Apparently Nvidia had developed a quadrilateral primitive chip they had been working on for over a year. 3D processing on a quadrilateral shape. All other competitors at the time were manufacturing on a triangle shape. Come to find out Microsofts new Directx Platform could only support triangle shaped primitives. Huang had bet on the wrong technology. Nvidia was left with a painful decision. keep working on the inferior chip for Dreamcast or stop working and run out of money right away. Unfortunately, it was all for not. Shortly after the meeting with the team Sega's president at the time, Shoichiro Irimaji, came to visit. He told Huang in person they were going with another graphics chip vendor for the Dreamcast. According to reports Huang had a relationship with the Sega president and worked together devise a new plan to keep the company afloat a little longer. Despite the failure Irimajiri believed in Huang and was confident in Nvidia. Irimajiri was able to convince Sega to invest $5million dollars into Nvidia. Huang and the team went to work on the RIVA128. With only around 6months of life support they worked rapidly to turn the ship around. In 4 months Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128's and used the revenue to develop its next generation of products and in 1998 had the release of the RIVA TNT which solidified Nvidia's reputation for developing capable graphics adapters. [wikipedia,nvidia corporation]. The ship was now full steam ahead.

In 1999 Nvidia went public! Irimajari and Sega had made a great investment and the company took the next leap. In late 1999 Nvidia developed the GeForce 256 (the first in the GeForce Product line). The GeForce was the first of its kind. A line of graphics cards that processed images in 3d form. In a computer history lesson from - Ben Hardwidge PC Games - he describes how the 3d games in 1999 processed 3d images. In 1999 if you wanted to display a 3d model it had to go through a graphics pipeline, which at this stage was all handled by the CPU. The first stage of the processing was the geometry, where the CPU worked out the positioning (where polygons and verticles will look under the "lighting" in the scene). The CPU would then have to process mathematical transformations and is usually referred to as "transform". Both processes together are called "transform & lighting" or T&L for short. Once the CPU locked in the geometry, it had to fill in the areas between the verticles, which is called rasterization, and pixel processing operations. These super complicated processes were how 3d graphics worked on the CPU at the time. Which made games look in low resolution, chunky graphics and poor performance.Then competitors came out with 3D Accelerators which handled the last stages of the pipeline (rasterization and pixel processing). These massively improved video game performance and looks. With the CPU no longer having to run all of the 3d operations they rendered 3d games at higher resolutions with more detail and faster frame rates. However, the CPU was still doing alot of work and you still needed a descent CPU to play these games. In late 1999 the GEForce ("The First GPU") changed the entire process and could process the entire 3D Graphics pipeline for the CPU. The integration of the transform and lighting hardware into the gpu itself set the GeForce apart from all the other 3d accelerators. The GPU unlocked new possibilities in gaming, visualization & parallel computing.

*Nvidia's Headstart*

The development of the GEForce line (GPU's) catapulted Nvidia as a massive technology leader. The technology and the ability to manufacture set Nvidia apart. Their manufacturing was moving at a rate no other competitors could. A the time there were roughly 30 - 3d graphics chip makers. None of them could compete w Nvidias design and manufacturing speed. They became the sole supplier supplier of graphics processors for Microsofts X-Box Gaming Console in January 2000 and started to enter new markets.

Nvidia was battling lawsuits at the time and settled them by developing strategic partnerships with the companies. It was a brilliant way to settle. Nvidia would soon take a company reorganization with some of those partners and nearly 50 graphics engineers came on board. Nvidia was growing and the reported revenue for 1999 was $374.5million dollars.

Things moved at a quicker pace. Chips were being designed and patented at record pace and Nvidia continued to battle lawsuits and race to find the next best thing. Computer design and function was on over-drive. Throughout 2000 Nvidia and Ontario based ATI were leapfrogging each other in design. Nvidia would ultimately won the race and after a patent fight with 3dfx Interactive Inc. Nvidia acquired 3dfx and again catapulted past the competition. Nvidia reported $735.3million in Revenue for 2000, nearly double from the previous year. In a Reference for Business news article, according to EBN, the number of firms producing graphics controllers had shrunk from 45 to 12.  Multiple key companies in the space, including Intel Corporation either left the market or completely cut back on their product development. Nvidia kept growing and by end of 2001 nearly doubled revenue again. Finishing the year w $1.37billion in revenue. 
Nvidia had the most expensive and best quality graphic processing units on the market. It maintained market control because of the quality and speed to which it was delivered. Nvidia was a preferred PC graphics chip by gamers everywhere. 
Over the next 15yrs Nvidia stayed relatively slow in growth. A couple bad year losses and a couple slow year increases, Nvidia averaged a 10% growth. Nvidia would be consistently developing and designing graphic processors but were looking for more.

  **Who is the company's intended customer?
   Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
   
   Originally Nvidia was created and targeted for the video gaming industry. Their target was just to make a better video game. Processing graphics, making sounds more realistic, 3d graphics, faster frame rates and quicker response times. This has always and still is Nvidias bread and butter. However, Their technology spurred the possibility of the processing for computers. This technology made it easier for processes to function in computers.  It turned out that the same technology that can conjure up an awesome 3d graphical alien landscape or paint a picture-perfect explosion is optimal in the hottest area of AI: Deep Learning. Deep Learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning. Deep Learning enables a computer to learn by itself, without programmers having to code everything by hand, and its lead to unparalleled levels of accuracy in areas like image and speech recognition. [Tilley, A.2016]  By 2006 Nvidia had developed CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).  This software development program was used to accelerate parallel computing. The CUDA platform enabled accelerated computing. That opened the door to a whole new customer and clientele. The platform opened a wide range of industries and sectors , including but not limited to, computer graphics, computational finance, data mining, machine learning & scientific computing. Computer software developers were now Nvidia's client as well.  In an article broken down in [DEEPLIZARD.com ] they break down the use of the software as a software platform that pairs with a company's  GPU hardware making it easier for their developers to build software that accelerates computations using the parallel processing power of Nvidia's GPU. In other words, CUDA was an information library that gave computers extra tools to operate more efficiently. This groundbreaking innovation became a landmark library for AI Developers AI and paved the way for accelerated computing.    This software sped up a computers processing time and gave it more information to be able to run more processes quicker. This opened Nvidias client base wide open. In 2011

**How is the company funded? 
How much funding have they received?**

   When Nvidia was founded it had $40,000 in the bank. After a short period of time they were bankrolled $20million from venture capitalists (Sequoia Capital and others) and were off to a racing start. As explained earlier,  in the mid 90's the company nearly collapsed and only a generosity from a Sega executive at the time saved Nvidia from the graveyard [Harper, C.2024]. Nvidia has had tremendous breakthroughs in technology and seems to be a consistent profit making company in a highly changing field. Their constant advancements have kept them ahead of the curve. However, throughout the companys history there have been constant lawsuits and litigations which have hurt the companys bottom line. They have been sued by competitors, sued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), class action lawsuits, sued for copyright infringement and as of monday will have to go in front of the Supreme Court in reference to a securities fraud lawsuit. Through all of the ups and downs though, Nvidia has consistently made advanced, high-quality computer GPU's. That particular product has been their lifeline and they have not changed. 
Nvidia has also received funding through government contracts like DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) but, most of Nvidia's assets are financed through equity. Typically companies with high debt-to-asset ratios are said to be highly leveraged. Today Jensen Huang is the largest individual share holder in Nvidia with about 4% of outstanding shares. The overall largest share holders are institutional share holders like BlackRock & Vanguard.  Nvidia has also built nice size investment portfolio throughout the years and has invested in a tremendous amount of start up AI companies to help the growth of AI.  

 

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** 

With the invention of CUDA in 2006 and the advancement of GPU's at the time, Nvidia had a tremendous headstart to data mining. This headstart is what seperated them from all of their competition. Their software was able to gather data quicker and faster before other companies had a chance to even see the full use or possibilities. By the time companies realized the potential it was too late. It was easier and more financially sound to purchase the CUDA programming and build from it . This was not only a competitive edge but a stronghold on AI technology as well. 
Jump 10 years later to 2016.. January 4, 2016, "Accelerating the race to autonomous cars, NVIDIA today launched NVIDIA DRIVEPX-2 - the world's most powerful engine for in vehicle artificial intelligence." [NVIDIA Newsroom 2016]. NVIDIA was going to change the automotive industry. Using Artificial Intelligence this engine was able to utilize Deep Learning on NVIDIAs advanced GPU. It was able to use 360-degree situational awareness to determine exactly where the car is and to compute a safe comfortable trajectory. The DRIVE PX-2's deep learning capabilities enabled it to quickly learn how to address everyday driving, road conditions, un expected road debris, crazy drivers, construction zones etc... Today, NVIDIAS generative AI is in every self-driving vehicle on the market (including Tesla). 
2017 NVIDIA highlights OPENAI's ChatGPT, the first AI application to reach 100 million users. ChatGPT building off of NVIDIA's GPU information began to grow. Some say NVIDIA was one of the founders of Artificial Intelligence and ChatGPT.

## Results

  

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Between 2000-2016 NVIDIA saw an average 10% growth per year. Since 2016 the company has nearly a 400% growth in revenue. The applications for their technology are constantly growing and there seems to be no real red flags (aside from the Supreme Court case). The trajectory potential for this company is tremendous. I would also point out the founders and the foundation of this company seems to be of good will. Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem are still contributors to this company and all 3 of them have made consistent large donations to charitable causes, their Alma-Maters and the advancement to higher learning. Chris is bringing a Quantum Super COmputer to his Alma Mater RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). All 3 men grew up loving the advancement of science and technology and it has never been about the money. 


 **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**
 Artificial Intelligence is a new field and advancing everyday. I do not know that there is a metric to decide its success as a company. This company is constantly adapting and advancing so I would say they are doing it right.

  
**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**
Artificial Intelligence is fast growing and big names like Amazon, Meta and Musk tend to hog the spotlight. Financially I feel Nvidia is doing well comparably. However, with competing to get market share and market confidence it definitley helps to be a household name. Which brings me to the next...

## Recommendations


  **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
If I could recommend a particular product I would recommend more creative AI special needs equipment (Ie. Wheelchairs, beds, household mobility equipment, mobility vehicles etc..) I have a son that has a severe spine condition and one of the main reasons I was fascinated about AI was the potential in science advancement for him. He has a really cool power chair now that is almost like a transformer because it can stand him up and sit him down real quick but I see the potential for the industry and the benefit for people it could be. 
  

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
This would open up another possibility for human advancement. Those that are mobility impaired are limited to opportunities. The more mobility and confidence in people the more opportunity for growth. The bigger pool of people that can help design and improve the world. 

  

** What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
The computer software could open up alot to a household in many ways. A chair that can help get you out of bed, a bed that can check your vitals etc.. 

  

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
Im not sure that they are but I am sure they would help. With the advancement in AI and the endless possibilities I see an opportunity to help so many.
